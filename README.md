In brewing, krausening (KROI-zen-ing) refers to adding a small amount of existing beer to fresh wort to 
prime the beer for carbonation.  In technology, Krausening is a project to populate finished archives for 
deployment.  This approach allows configuration properties to be externalized from deployment units, 
enabling the same deployment unit to be leveraged repeatedly without the need to rebuild or hack the 
archive.
